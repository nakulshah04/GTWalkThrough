GTWalkThrough is an app for the use of Georgia Tech students that will feature an interactive map displaying all current construction blocks.

Key Features
* Display exactly which entrances, sidewalks, and roads are closed (to make commutes more predictable for users).
* Community-driven, where users can report new construction zones and report completed construction zones.
* Reroute student commutes around construction zones.

Admins will also be able to manually implement these changes. They will also have the power of approving or declining a report from a user to strengthen true information and weaken false information.

Technologies
* Google Maps JS API
* Python Django
* HTML and CSS

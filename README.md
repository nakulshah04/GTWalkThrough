GTWalkThrough is an app for the use of Georgia Tech students that will feature an interactive map displaying all current construction blocks.

Key Features
* Will show exactly which entrances, sidewalks, and roads are closed to make commutes more predictable for users.
* Community-driven, where users can report newly opened, closed, or shifted construction zones.
* Reroute student commutes around construction zones in the most time-efficient manner.

Admins will also be able to manually implement these changes if needed. We will implement navigation and map APIs for the features of open-source mapping and route optimization.
